[mod-setting-description]
RBCF_limit_radius_setting=Don't worry about performance!!! The mod is highly optimized and will support even the largest construction areas with no problems!!!\n\nThis setting is for limiting the maximum construction area. If you feel like the area you are using is too big and becomes impractical in a gameplay sense, you can limit the area here, and it will not increase past the set value. If the limit is bigger than the maximum construction area your equipment setup supports, then that maximum will be used.
RBCF_use_limit_when_off_setting=This setting only applies when the mod is toggled OFF via the shortcut (the buttons next to the item quick access bar).\n  Setting ON: Construction area limit applies when mod is toggled off. \n  Setting OFF: The maximum construction area of your current equipment setup is used when Mod is toggled off.
